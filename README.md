# SONY FRAMEWORK REMASTER
 
### Background:
Made by Zenith, Sony Apps Enabler is a ported version of Sony devices' framework files for any Android device. This tricks Play Store into recognizing your Android as a Sony device and therefore, allowing you to install and update Sony devices specific apps directly from Play Store.
